Q1. Let us say your expense for every month are listed below, January - 2200 February - 2350 March - 2600 April - 2130 May - 2190 Create a list to store these monthly expenses and using that find out,

In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?
Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year.
Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and got a refund of 200$. Make a correction to your monthly expense list based on this

expense=[
    {0: 2200},
    {1: 2350},
    {2:2600},
    {3:2130},
    {4:2190},
]
print(str(int(expense[1][1]- expense[0][0])) + "$ extra I spent compared to Jan")    #
print(str(int(expense[0][0]+expense[1][1]+expense[2][2]))+" $ is my total expense in first quarter of the year")
for i in range(0,5):
  if(expense[i][i]==2000):
    print(str(int(expense[i][i])) + " is in the month of",i+1)
    break
else:
  print("No you've not spent 2000$ exactly in any month")

expense.append({5:1980})
print("Expense at the end of June is",expense)
expense[3][3]=2130-200
print("Expense after 200$ refund in April",expense)


Q2. You have a list of your favourite marvel super heros. heros=['spider man','thor','hulk','iron man','captain america'] Using this find out,

Length of the list
Add 'black panther' at the end of this list
You realize that you need to add 'black panther' after 'hulk', so remove it from the list first and then add it after 'hulk'
Now you don't like thor and hulk because they get angry easily :) So you want to remove thor and hulk from list and replace them with doctor strange (because he is cool). Do that with one line of code.
Sort the heros list in alphabetical oheros=['spider man','thor','hulk','iron man','captain america']
print("Length of the list is", len(heros))
heros.append('black panther')
print('Added black panther at the end of the list',heros)
heros.remove('black panther')
print("Removed black panther from the list",heros)
heros[3]=('black panther')
print("Added black panther after hulk",heros)
heros[1:3]=['doctor strange']
print("Removed thor and hulk bcz they get angry easily and replaced them with doctor strange ",heros)
heros.sort()
print("Sorted list",heros)rder (Hint. Use dir() functions to list down all functions available in list)
